Sample project to show how to work with Spring's @Configurable capability to inject dependencies into classes not instantiated by Spring.

This implementation requires Maven to perform compile time weaving.

To run from the command line using Maven:

1. `mvn clean compile`
2. `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.brightdome.sample.spring.HelloWorld"`
